# 2048 Deployment by Team Bravo EKS 🚀 ![Build Passing](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)

### This project is a deployment of the classic 2048 game hosted using AWS EKS by Team Bravo.👥🤝

This app is a straightforward yet engaging game where players combine numbered tiles to achieve the elusive 2048 tile through careful planning and strategic movements. 🎮🕹️🧩

## Project Description 📄

![alt text](image.png)

This project was undertaken to deploy the 2048 game as a cloud-native application using Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). The primary goal was to demonstrate the scalability, resilience, and efficiency of modern cloud platforms in hosting containerised applications. By leveraging cloud services, we showcased the ability to manage and deploy applications seamlessly in a distributed environment, focusing on performance, reliability, and ease of management.

## Local App Set Up 🖥️

```
python -m http.server 3000
```
- This command starts a simple HTTP server that serves files from the current directory on port 3000. This is commonly used for local development or testing static websites and applications.

```
http://localhost:3000/
```
- When running the previous command, it allows you to access your app in a browser via http://localhost:3000, serving any files in the current directory or subdirectories.

## Trello Board Workflow ✅

![alt text](image-1.png)

This Trello board is an EKS Project Workflow designed to manage tasks effectively across different stages of the development process. It features columns for Backlog, In Progress, PR Reviews, and Done, ensuring a clear workflow from task initiation to completion. Each card represents specific tasks, such as setting up EKS clusters, deploying NGINX controllers, or configuring CI/CD pipelines, assigned to team members for collaboration and accountability. The structure supports seamless tracking of progress and prioritization.

## Docker Setup 🐳

```
 docker build -t 2048-repo . 
```

This command will create a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory (.). The -t flag tags the image with the name "2048-repo", allowing for easy reference in later Docker operations.

## Dockerfile Explanation 📖💡
![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-11-27 195220.png>)

This Dockerfile is a multistage build designed for a lightweight and efficient deployment of a Python-based application. It uses Python's Alpine image for the building stage, which is minimal in size, and leverages Google's distroless Python image for the runtime stage to reduce attack surface and ensure security.

### Breakdown Of Multi-stage Build ✍️

#### Stage 1: Builder 🔧
```
FROM python:3.11-alpine AS builder
```
- Specifies the base image for the build stage, using Python 3.11's Alpine variant. The AS builder label identifies this stage for referencing later.
```
WORKDIR /app
```
- Sets the working directory inside the container to /app.
```
COPY . .
```
- Copies all files from the project directory on the host to the /app directory in the container.
##
### Stage 2: Runtime 🌐

```
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3
```
- Sets the base image for the final runtime stage, using a secure, minimal distroless image with Python 3.
```
WORKDIR /app
```
- Establishes /app as the working directory for this stage, matching the builder stage's setup.
```
COPY --from=builder /app /app
```
- Copies the contents of the /app directory from the builder stage into the /app directory of the runtime container.
```
EXPOSE 3000
```
- Declares that the application will use port 3000. This is informative for tools but doesn’t directly affect container behaviour.
```
CMD ["-m", "http.server", "3000"]
```
- Specifies the command to run when the container starts. In this case, it launches a simple HTTP server on port 3000 using Python's built-in module.
